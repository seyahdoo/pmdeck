Deck may go to sleep
Deck wifi connection may disconnect
Deck may change ip (disconnect and connect via different ip)
Server may change ip (disconnect and connect via different ip)
Server may disconnect

solution: each device will have a dynamic database of device_id to device_ip,device_port


if a device is synced to certain device_id, on on_hello(device_id) function, it will connect

if a device is not synced, on on_hello(device_id) it will try to sync


on change self ip or port re announce myself to network


for each devices found in network, send
->"HELLO:device_id, connection_ip, connection_port;"
(no response) (close connection)

if "Hello:synced_device_id, xx, xx" received
connect to xx, xx



-NO

//Synced device connection
service id: deviceID.pmdeck.tcp.local
name: ip:port.pmdeck.tcp.local

//On Synced, deck will only listen on syncedDeviceID.pmdeck.tcp.local
//And just connect


//Syncing
service id: sync.pmdeck.tcp.local
name ip:port.sync.pmdeck.tcp.local

//if Deck not Synced it will discover sync.pmdeck.tcp.local
//and do syncing ritual


Server will always register serverID.pmdeck.tcp.local
if Server wants a new Deck it will register sync.pmdeck.tcp.local
