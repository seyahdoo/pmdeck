Deck may go to sleep
Deck wifi connection may disconnect
Deck may change ip (disconnect and connect via different ip)
Server may change ip (disconnect and connect via different ip)
Server may disconnect

solution: each device will have a dynamic database of device_id to device_ip,device_port


if a device is synced to certain device_id, on on_hello(device_id) function, it will connect

if a device is not synced, on on_hello(device_id) it will try to sync


on change self ip or port re announce myself to network


for each devices found in network, send
->"HELLO:device_id, connection_ip, connection_port;"
(no response) (close connection)

if "Hello:synced_device_id, xx, xx" received
connect to xx, xx
